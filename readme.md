This is a personal Test bed for all sorts of Client development, it's mainly for myself to learn Java and client Development as a whole and improve on what i already know in some sort of real life scenario, anyone wanting to download this can freely do it, although its highly unlikely even anything will work. I also do not guarantee that i will upload a fully built version of the client, meaning anyone wanting to use this, will likely first need to build it with a tool like graddle.

Main Credit goes to the People that ported the old oyvey source code and base from 1.12.2 to 1.21.1, if you want the original source code which i am baseing this test bed of, then click on the following link:
